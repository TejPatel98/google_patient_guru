# Google Patient Guru 

This project was worked on for VolHacks 2018 Hackathon. 

The platform used was Google Home. We made it act as a patient so that med-school students dont need to rely on actors to practice their diagnostic skills. They can even practice at home and get better at it.

Google-Home gets into the role of an actual "patient" and the user now takes up the role of the "doctor". The patient walks in and greets the doctor. Upon the doctor's introduction, the patient introduces themselves and answers questions as to what he/she is feeling like and how did it all begin. Upon further questioning, the patient talks about his/her symptoms. Finally, the doctor associates the probable disease that the patient may be suffering through, from the symptoms.

The doctor (user) gets to practice the diagnostics skills such as:

- Greeting the patient and having proper bed-side etiquettes.
- Posting questions to reach the root cause.
- Ask probing questions, to the patient, to get the symptoms from them.
- Proposing a probable disease based on the symptoms.
- Giving a good "Doctor's Report".
